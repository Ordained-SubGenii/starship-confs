## Here is how you can shorten some long paths by text replacement
## similar to mapped_locations in Oh My Posh:

[directory.substitutions]
"Documents" = " "
"Downloads" = " "
#"Music" = " "
"Pictures" = " "
## Keep in mind that the order matters. For example:
## "Important Documents" = "  "
## will not be replaced, because "Documents" was already substituted before.
## So either put "Important Documents" before "Documents" or use the substituted version:
## "Important  " = "  "
